# AngularD3

This project integrates the d3 force-directed graph with an AngularJS interface for the data and controls. 
More information about the d3 graph can be found here:

AngularJS provides two-way data binding between the client and the application, allowing data to be dynamically entered and modified. This data can be fed into d3 to create a dynamically updating force-directed graph. 

You can see a working demo of the latest release here:
